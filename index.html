            Though pudits and scholars alike are still debating the reasons for Donald Trump's victory, it is clear that Twitter played an important role in the 2016 presidential election.
            This factor is crucial as social media services (like Twitter) allow anyone, anywhere to engage in conversations and debates of the sort which in the past would have been reserved for the dinner tables, water-coolers, or other intimate social events.
            Beacuse of this, social scientists, journalists and businesses alike view social media as a measurable conduit of public opinion.
            Thusly, tweets can be used to help determine which events during the election changed the fundamental dynamics of the campaign.
